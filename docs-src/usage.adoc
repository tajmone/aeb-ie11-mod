= Using AEB IE11 Mod

Using *AEB IE11 Mod* in your own Activ E-Book publications is really easy, you only have to follow a couple of steps, as described in the following sections.


[#obtain-binary]
== Obtaining AEB IE11 Mod

First of all, download the latest precompiled binaries distribution from the repository
https://github.com/tajmone/aeb-ie11-mod/releases/latest/[_Releases_ page^, title="Go to the releases page at the AEB IE11 Mod repository"]
 -- i.e. the file named `AEB-IE11-Mod-{revnumber}-binaries.zip`, which contains the precompiled *AEB IE11 Mod* application, this documentation, two demo Activ E-Books and <<batch-helpers,a couple of helper scripts>>.

TIP: If you prefer to build *AEB IE11 Mod* from source, refer to <<compiling>>.

The actual *AEB IE11 Mod* application is the `aeb-ie11-mod.exe` executable file which you'll find inside the precompiled binaries distribution.


== E-Book Setup

In order to enable IE11 support in your E-Books, you'll need to add the `aeb-ie11-mod.exe` file to the contents folder of your Activ E-Book project, along with the HTML files, stylesheets, etc., because you need to ensure that the *AEB IE11 Mod* application is being distributed along with your standalone E-Book, so that it can be accessed by the E-Book itself.

.Re-scan Source Folder
IMPORTANT: After adding `aeb-ie11-mod.exe` to your contents folder, don't forget to re-scan the folder in your Activ E-Book project (using the menu:Edit[Scan Folder...] menu or via the kbd:[Ctrl+D] keyboard shortcut), otherwise it won't be included in the final compiled E-Book.

.AEB IE11 Mod Is 32-bit
NOTE: Since Activ E-Books are 32-bit applications, *AEB IE11 Mod* is also compiled as a 32-bit application, to ensure that it will work on 32-bit machines too.

[#on-start-str]
The next step is to tell your E-Book project to launch *AEB IE11 Mod* when the E-Book starts.
Open the menu:Edit[Add-Ins...] menu, then paste into the menu:On Start[] field the following string (as-is, _verbatim_):

..............................................
{ebook}\aeb-ie11-mod.exe "{exename}" "{title}"
..............................................

.Quoted Parameters
IMPORTANT: Don't forget to include the double-quotes around the parameters, they are required to correctly handle spaces in file paths and the E-Book Title.

.Quotation Marks in E-Book Titles
WARNING: If your E-Book Title contains straight double quotes (`+++"+++`), you must follow the instructions provided in <<dq-in-title>>, otherwise *AEB IE11 Mod* won't work properly.

Here's a screenshot of the above steps, taken from the `Demo AEB IE11 Mod.aep` project included in the source repository (but not in the binary distribution package):

As you may have noticed, the menu:On Start[] string contains some predefined Activ Variables, which will be expanded to their represented value at run-time, when these parameters are passed to *AEB IE11 Mod*:

[horizontal]
`{ebook}` :: The directory path where the E-Book is being unpacked.
Used to locate the `aeb-ie11-mod.exe` executable and invoke it.

`{exename}` :: The full path of the E-Book EXE file.
Used by *AEB IE11 Mod* to extract the E-Book filename and create the Windows Registry key to enable browser emulation for the E-Book, and then to restart the E-Book.

`{title}` :: The Title of the E-Book, as entered in the menu:E-Book Info[] menu.
Used by *AEB IE11 Mod* to find the E-Book handle via its window title, in order to close the E-Book.


With the above information, provided by the E-Book at start-up, the *AEB IE11 Mod* is able to check whether the E-Book executable is registered as a subkey of `FEATURE_BROWSER_EMULATION` in the Windows Registry, and that it's set to the correct IE version value, and act accordingly.


== Suppressing the Restart Dialog

By the default, *AEB IE11 Mod* will display a pop-up dialog to the end user when the E-Book needs to be restarted:

image::restart-dialog.png[align="center"]

The rationale behind this pop-up dialog is to inform the user on the reason why the E-Book is being restarted -- something which he/she will notice if the E-Book shows a splash image at start-up, since the splash (and its progress bar) will be shown twice.
Without the dialog explaining why the E-Book is being restarted, the end user might feel suspicious about the double launch (although it only occurs the first time the E-Book is opened).

While the splash image was originally intended to show signs of life while the E-Book was loading, with modern hardware E-Book loading happens almost in real time, confining the splash image to a mere aesthetic role (to display your logo, the E-Book cover, etc.).

If you're not using a splash image, you might want to suppress the restart dialog of *AEB IE11 Mod*, since without the splash image the IE11 emulation hack will happen seamlessly, without the end user noticing a thing.

To disable the restart dialog, just append a space separator and the `/Q` (quiet) switch to the string passed in menu:Edit[Add-Ins > On Start] (<<on-start-str,as described here>>):

.................................................
{ebook}\aeb-ie11-mod.exe "{exename}" "{title}" /Q
.................................................


== Reverting Browser Emulation

During the development stage, you'll probably want to revert your E-Book to it's pristine state, i.e. before *AEB IE11 Mod* enabled IE11 emulation via the Registry.
To achieve this, all you need to do is delete the Registry key created by *AEB IE11 Mod* for your E-Book.

WARNING: Just _be careful_ when dealing with the Registry.
Randomly deleting keys, or editing their values, might result in system instability, unexpected behaviors, and even render Windows unusable.
Avoid experimenting, unless you know what you're doing.

[#batch-helpers]
Inside the {demo_folder} you'll find two batch helper scripts which can aid you with Registry-related tasks:

* {delete_bat}
* {show_bat}

The {show_bat} script is just a convenience helper that launches the Windows Registry Editor (*regedit*) at the `FEATURE_BROWSER_EMULATION` key:

.Windows Registry with browser emulation key of demo E-Book selected
image::regedit.png[align="center", role="thumb"]

Using this script will save you time, since you won't have to navigate through the Registry to find the `FEATURE_BROWSER_EMULATION` key.
You might want to use this script just once, since the Registry Editor allows you to add key-paths to your Favorites list (via the menu:Favorites[Add to Favorites...] menu), a "`bookmarks`" system of sorts.

Now that you have access to the `FEATURE_BROWSER_EMULATION` entries in the registry, you can manually delete the emulation key of your E-Book.
Spotting the E-Book key is easy, because it has the same name as your E-Book executable file.
The `FEATURE_BROWSER_EMULATION` key works on a _per filename_ basis (just the filename, without the full path).

The other script ({delete_bat}) allows you to quickly delete the `FEATURE_BROWSER_EMULATION` Registry key created by the *AEB IE11 Mod* demo E-Book â€” only the Registry entry for `Demo AEB IE11 Mod.exe` will be affected, nothing else.
You can reuse this script for you own E-Book projects, you'll just need to edit its last line, by replacing `Demo AEB IE11 Mod.exe` with the filename of your compiled E-Book:

```
REG DELETE "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main\FeatureControl\FEATURE_BROWSER_EMULATION" /v "Demo AEB IE11 Mod.exe"
```

IMPORTANT: Don't forget to enclose the E-Book filename between double-quotes, as in the script.

Once your adapted script is ready, it will provide a quick and safe way to reset your Activ E-Book to its pristine state, allowing you go through the E-Book "`first run`" procedure multiple times, and check the *AEB IE11 Mod* behavior before and after IE11 emulation is enabled.

TIP: Don't forget that whenever you change the filename of your compiled E-Book (in the {AEBCompiler} project settings, or by renaming the generated E-Book executable), a new registry key will be created, matching the new filename.
To avoid cluttering your Registry, delete any old keys associated with E-Book filenames that are no longer in use.


== License

* The original copyright notice
* A copy of the license itself

In practical terms, if you're including the `aeb-ie11-mod.exe` executable in your E-Book, then you must add due credits somewhere in the E-Book (the "`About`" page would be the perfect place) so that the reader can acknowledge that your E-Book is using *AEB IE11 Mod*, and learn who authored the latter, its Copyright status and license.
Here's an example of how the text should look like:

===============================================
