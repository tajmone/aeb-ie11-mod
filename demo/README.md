# E-Book Projects

There are two demo E-Books, one (`Demo AEB IE11 Mod.exe`) showing the **AEB IE11 Mod** in action, the other (`Demo Default.exe`) showing the default behavior of Activ E-Book (i.e. without the IE11 mod), so that the same HTML/CSS3 contents can be compared with and without the IE11 emulation mod.

Neither E-Book is included in the repository in compiled form (i.e. their `.exe` files are not tracked by Git), only their [Activ E-Book Compiler] projects are (i.e. their `.aep` files). To obtain the compiled E-Books, download the latest precompiled binary distribution from the repository [_Releases_ page], or compile them yourself ([see warning note](#aeb-projects-warning)).

Both E-Books share the same contents source folder:

- [`/html/`][html/]
    + `aeb-ie11-mod.exe` (_after compiling_)
    + [`index.html`][index.html]
    + [`styles.css`][styles.css]

The `aeb-ie11-mod.exe` file is not included in the repository (i.e. not tracked by Git) and needs to be generated by compiling the [PureBasic] source project in the [`../src/`][src/] folder.


## The Default Demo E-Book

The default demo E-Book project and its assets, showing the default-behavior of Activ E-Books (i.e. without using **AEB IE11 Mod**):

- `Demo Default.aep`
- `Demo Default.exe` (_after compiling_)
- [`splash-default.bmp`][splash-default.bmp]

Here's a screenshot of the `Demo Default.exe` E-Book:

![Demo Default screenshot](../docs-src/img/demo-default.png)

As you can see from the screenshot, CSS3 styles and effects are being ignored, and the JavaScript snippet is detecting the browser as Internet Explorer version 7.


## The AEB IE11 Mod Demo E-Book

The **AEB IE11 Mod** demo E-Book project and its assets:

- `Demo AEB IE11 Mod.aep`
- `Demo AEB IE11 Mod.exe` (_after compiling_)
- [`splash-ie11-mod.bmp`][splash-ie11-mod.bmp]

Here's a screenshot of the `Demo AEB IE11 Mod.exe` E-Book:

![Demo AEB IE11 Mod screenshot](../docs-src/img/demo-ie11.png)

As you can see from the screenshot, CSS3 styles and effects are being shown properly, even though it's the same HTML page and stylesheet used in the `Demo Default.exe` E-Book, and the JavaScript snippet is now detecting the browser as Internet Explorer version 11.


### Batch Helpers

I've also included two batch script helpers for this E-Book:

- [`delete-registry-key.bat`][delete-registry-key.bat] — deletes the IE11 emulation registry key for this E-Book.
- [`show-registry-entries.bat`][show-registry-entries.bat] — open Registry Editor at `FEATURE_BROWSER_EMULATION`.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first script ([`delete-registry-key.bat`][delete-registry-key.bat]) allows you to quickly delete the `FEATURE_BROWSER_EMULATION` Registry key created by the AEB IE11 Mod demo E-Book to enable IE11 emulation for itself — only the Registry entry for `Demo AEB IE11 Mod.exe` will be affected, and nothing else. This allows you to experience again, first hand, how the E-Book using **AEB IE11 Mod** behaves the first time it's opened by an end user.

If you want to reuses this script for you own E-Book projects, you'll just need to edit its last line, by replacing `Demo AEB IE11 Mod.exe` with the filename of your compiled E-Book:

```
REG DELETE "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main\FeatureControl\FEATURE_BROWSER_EMULATION" /v "Demo AEB IE11 Mod.exe"
```

(don't forget to enclose the E-Book filename between double-quotes, as in the script)

The `FEATURE_BROWSER_EMULATION` key works on a _per filename_ basis (just the filename, without the full path).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The other script ([`show-registry-entries.bat`][show-registry-entries.bat]) opens the Windows Registry Editor (**regedit**) at `FEATURE_BROWSER_EMULATION`:

![Registry Editor: FEATURE_BROWSER_EMULATION](../docs-src/img/regedit.png)

It's just a convenience helper to save you time navigating through the Registry. You might want to use it just once, since the Registry Editor allows you to add key-paths to your Favorites list (via the **Favorites** &gt; **Add to Favorites…** menu).

> **WARNING** — Just _be careful_ when dealing with the Registry. Randomly deleting keys, or editing their values, might result in system instability, unexpected behaviors, and even render Windows unusable. Avoid experimenting, unless you know what you're doing.


# AEB Projects Warning

Since these Activ E-Book projects where created on my PC, they contain absolute path to my machine which won't match your local repository path. In order to compile the E-Books on your machine, you'll need to manually update the projects by re-scanning the source folder using your local absolute path to the [`/html/`][html/] directory, and fix other similar issues relating to E-Book assets path differences (splash screen, icon, etc.).
